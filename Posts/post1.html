				<p class="text-center text-light"> 
					Black Clover (TV) is, in my opinion, one of the greatest ongoing Animes I have ever seen. The storyline is great and characters are likeable. It is a fantastic way to pass time if you have no other shows to watch. This review will only cover my initial thoughts on episode 1. Since it's the beginning, you are probably safe to keep reading because of no spoilers. Anyways, without further a-do, let us get to it.

				<h1 class="text-center text-info"> Introduction </h1>
				<p class="text-center text-light"> 
					Let's start with well, the synopsis. Two boys, Asta and Yuno, were abandoned during childhood in a church and as they grow up, they compete to become the wizard king, the highest rank a magic knight could achieve. Normally, people read the synopsis and head straight for episode 1. For me, I head straight to the first episode without reading the synopsis and see where I could go from there.

				<h1 class="text-center text-info"> First Impressions </h1>
				<p class="text-center text-light"> 
					A couple of seconds in the show, I see Asta and Yuno when they were babies. Asta is a rough baby that kicks the father of the church while Yuno is the calm one. I am not going to lie, they were adorable in that form. Then, the next thing I knew, I hear an obnoxious yelling. Our main protagonist, Asta has an annoying yell that made me drop the show the first time it aired. Interestingly, the show did not have an opening cutscene yet. A couple of months or years go by, my cousin and brother felt like watching the show for the first time and they enjoyed it. They convinced me to rewatch it and continue to since they told me "it gets interesting the further you get. First 4 episodes were trash". They also told me that I'd get used to his yelling if you focus on the storyline than his character.

				<h1 class="text-center text-info"> Conclusion </h1>
				<p class="text-center text-light"> 
					Overall, my first impression of Black Clover was not so great, but going back towards the beginning and enduring the annoying yelling, it is not a bad Anime after a few episodes. I recommend watching it if you have a lot of time, since it took me about 2-3 weeks to get caught up on the latest episodes.
