        <p class = 'bg-white'>
        	During my senior year of high school, I had thought of becoming anything from the medical field. My family suggested that I should become a doctor or a pharmacist since they make good money. I was fine with that suggestion, but never decided on one thing. I love video games and computers. I always play the support characters that heals my teammates.
