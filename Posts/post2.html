				<p class="text-center text-light"> Allina came from an alternate dimension different from ours. She wanted to meet humans in their world, but it all did not go as planned when a bug was found in her friend's programmable portal. Instead of going into the human realm, she can was transported into the internet browsers where any human could find her. To test her communications skills, she asks whoever is behind the screen a number between 1 to 1000.

				<p class="text-center text-light"> So, this was actually the second homework assignment I had to do in my Java 1 class. I thought it would be a good idea to implement this in Javascript since they both have the same first four letters in its name. It took me almost 2-3 hours just to get one thing to work on this translation. The buttons and layouts costed a lot of my time, but it was a worth it. I also wanted a character to guess your number, but most of the characters were licensed and I would feel bad to use them without permission. So, I drew one.
